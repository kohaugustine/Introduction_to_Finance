    "This notebook contains all the computations that I ran to solve questions from Assignments number 2 of the Coursera Introduction to Finance Course. I may not note down my work for every single question, but for those that I find particularly difficult and noteworthy, I will also paste the question here followed by my code statements to solve the question. I will be mainly using functions from a module which I have written that sits in the same folder as where all the notebooks are stored. If the question requires an ad-hoc calculation for which I have no function coded for that, I will express the statements for the calculations directly here in this notebook."

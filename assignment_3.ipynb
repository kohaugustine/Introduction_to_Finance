    "This notebook contains all the computations that I ran to solve questions from Assignments number 2 of the Coursera Introduction to Finance Course. I may not note down my work for every single question, but for those that I find particularly difficult and noteworthy, I will also paste the question here followed by my code statements to solve the question. I will be mainly using functions from a module which I have written that sits in the same folder as where all the notebooks are stored. If the question requires an ad-hoc calculation for which I have no function coded for that, I will express the statements for the calculations directly here in this notebook."

    "#### In high school Jeff often made money in the summer by mowing lawns in the neighborhood. He just finished his freshman year of college and, after taking a Business 101 class, he has some ideas about how to scale up his lawn mowing operation. Previously, he had used his father's push mower, but he is thinking about getting a riding mower that will save time and allow him to do more lawns. He found a used, zero turn, riding mower on Craigslist for $\\$$1,400. He will also need a trailer to pull the mower behind his pickup; that will cost him an additional $\\$$500. With the new mower he can take on an additional 23 lawns per week at an average cash inflow of $\\$$22 per lawn he will receive at the end of each week. He has 13 weeks of summer in which to mow lawns. (For convenience, assume that the mower and trailer will have no value after Jeff is done with his work this summer.) The discount rate for Jeff is 10% (note that this is an annual rate). What is the Net Present Value of the mower/trailer project?"

The formulae is given on p.3, equation (7), of the Note on Formulae, but I would encourage you to try doing it in Excel as well.

As an example, the present value of an annuity that starts one year from now at $\\$$100, and grows at 5%, with the last cash flow in year 10, when the discount rate is 7%, is $\\$$860.

    "#### Diane has just turned 19 and also completed high school. She is wondering about the value of a college education.

Based on historical trends she estimates that tuition will rise at 5% per year for the 4 years she is in school. She also estimates that her living expense above and beyond tuition will be $\\$$8,000 per year (assume this occurs at the end of the year) for the first year and will increase $\\$$500 each year thereafter to keep up with inflation. She does not plan to work at all while attending school. Were she to forgo college she would be able to make $\\$$23,000 per year out of high school and expects that to grow 3% annually. With the college degree, she estimates that she will earn $\\$$47,000 per year out of college, again with annual 3% increases in salary. Either way, she plans to work until 64 (she begins college right away). The interest/discount rate is 8%. What is the NPV of her college education?

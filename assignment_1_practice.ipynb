    "This notebook contains all the computations that I ran to solve questions from Assignment number 1 of the Coursera Introduction to Finance Course. I may not note down my work for every single question, but for those that I find particularly difficult and noteworthy, I will also paste the question here followed by my code statements to solve the question. I will be mainly using functions from a module which I have written that sits in the same folder as where all the notebooks are stored. If the question requires an ad-hoc calculation for which I have no function coded for that, I will express the statements for the calculations directly here in this notebook."

    "#### Jessica is in the market for a new car. She has narrowed her search down to 2 models. Model A costs $\\$$24,000 and Model B costs $\\$$18,000. With both cars she plans to pay cash and own them for 3 years before trading in for a new car. Her research indicates that the trade in value for Model A after 3 years is 50% of the initial purchase price, while the trade in value for Model B is 25%. Jessica has no emotional attachment to either model and wants to make a strictly financial decision. The interest rate is 6%. For simplicity assume that operating and maintenance costs for the models are identical every year. Which model is the better decision and how much \"cheaper\" is it than the alternative?"

I may not note down my work for every single question, but for those that I find particularly difficult and noteworthy, I will also paste the question here followed by my code statements to solve the question. I will be mainly using functions from a module which I have written that sits in the same folder as where all the notebooks are stored. If the question requires an ad-hoc calculation for which I have no function coded for that, I will express the statements for the calculations directly here in this notebook."

However, you are also concerned that your employees are just as likely to download apps that will distract them from their work, leading them to play games and update their social networking sites rather than focus on the job of pleasing clients. To test this you randomly select 6 employees for an experiment. You provide 3 with the new smart phone and the other 3 use their existing technology. The following chart shows their changes in sales. Based on this small sample, what is the correlation in percentage between smartphone and increase in sales? It may help to use the spreadsheet function CORREL to calculate the correlation. {Anthony, Smartphone: No; change in sales 130; Kira, Smartphone Yes; Change in Sales 50; Michael, Smartphone No; Change in Sales 150; Scarlett, Smartphone Yes; Change in Sales 120; Pete, Smartphone No; Change in Sales 40; Angela, Smartphone Yes; Change in Sales 40.} (No more than two decimals in the percentage but do not enter the % sign.)"

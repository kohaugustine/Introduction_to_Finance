However, it turns out that this is wrong again! I still don't really understand why I can't compare in terms of $FV$ for this question, but I'm starting to get the drift that whenever we are talking about loans and making repayments, decisions that we have to make in the present, such as our question here asking us to decide whether to refinance now or not, we should be finding $PV$. It is mainly in cases where we are concerned with outcomes in the future, such as the result of investments which we have already made in the present, that we find $FV$. Basically I was trying to look at things from the perspective of the bank, for what is a loan to us, could be considered as an investment to them right? I mean the bank could be looking at the FV as the total amount it would be receiving from me as loan repayment by the end of the period, and the choice that gives the bank a larger $FV$ at the end would be the choice that is worse off for me, right?

To achieve this, I simply subtracted total repayments made between 60th to the 240th month (end of 20 years) away the remaining principal (ie. the loan balance) owed after making the 60th month payment under the old contract, thereby giving me the total interest payments made under both contracts that I can compare.

    "Eventually I trawled through the forums looking for help and finally found a solution by Kumar A Mandal https://class.coursera.org/introfinance-009/forum/thread?thread_id=37#post-561 that made good sense and I followed it. The main gist of it is to basically find the cost of monthly payment under the refinancing contract and find the difference of that with the original contract to get the monthly savings I could obtain by doing refinancing. I would then find the PV of all these savings and subtract that by the refinancing fee to get the total savings as my final result. Here's the timeline diagram by Kumar:"

After 36 months you may buy the car for $\\$$10,900. (iii) Purchase the car from Dealer C who will lend you the entire purchase price of the car for a zero interest 36-month loan with monthly payments. The car price is $\\$$19,000.

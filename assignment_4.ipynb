I will be mainly using functions from a module which I have written that sits in the same folder as where all the notebooks are stored. If the question requires an ad-hoc calculation for which I have no function coded for that, I will express the statements for the calculations directly here in this notebook."

    "#### The city of Middleville is considering offering public bus service. Setting up the service will cost the city $\\$$1.1M (where M stands for million). The useful life of the buses is 27 years. Annual maintenance of the buses would cost $\\$$86,000 per year and they would need a major overhaul in year 21 that will cost a total of $\\$$560,000. This overhaul is in addition to the annual maintenance. Annual labor and administrative costs will begin at $\\$$120,000 in year 1 and grow at 2.5% per year thereafter. The buses will generate a revenue of $\\$$170,000 in year 1 and it will grow at 4.5% per year thereafter. Reduced parking requirements and other benefits generated by the project will save the city $\\$$270,000 per year. The salvage value (price the city can get in the future after maintenance) of the used buses in year 27 is expected to be $\\$$290,000. What is the NPV of the bus proposal? The city does not pay taxes and the discount rate is 5.9%.

    "#### Walmart is considering opening a small experimental store in New York City. A store is expected to have a long economic life, but the valuation horizon is 13 years. The store in New York is likely to generate revenues of \\$33M in the first year and then it grows at 5.5%. But the costs of running the business are high because the margins on all the products sold are low. (It is a volume business!) The cost of goods sold is \\$10M in year 1 and it is expected to grow at 2.0% per year thereafter. Selling and administration costs are likely to be \\$1.4M every year as it is a small store. The tax rate is 35%. Walmart is so good at managing its stores that working capital increases can be assumed to be negligible. But since New York City is an expensive place, Walmart will have to invest \\$225M in purchasing a building (with land) even though it is a much smaller property than a usual Walmart store. The good news is that this outlay can be straight line depreciated over 13 years. Also, Walmart has estimated that the after-tax terminal value in year 13 dollars is $125M. This value is the present value of all cash flows in year 14 and beyond. What is the NPV of opening this new store if the appropriate discount rate is 4.0%?
